Description
-----------

Node.js is a great platform for building I/O bound apps. At eBay, my team applied node.js to solve a very common chore - how to get data from server-side HTTP APIs (or "web services") quickly. [ql.io](http://ql.io) is a result of this work. 

ql.io consists of two parts 

1. A SQL + JSON inspired DSL for HTTP
2. A runtime that you can can either deploy as an HTTP gateway or use as a JS API for node.js based apps. 

In this talk, I will show how you can use ql.io, the agility and performance gains that ql.io can bring in, and then take a deep dive into some of the design choices we made under the hood.
