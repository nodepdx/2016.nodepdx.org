## Description

Have you ever watched Star Trek where the tell the computer to do something like turn off the lights and it just works?  It's pretty amazing, and I've always been a big fan of computer automation making our lives easier.  

This talk will walk you through the basics of using the Amazon Echo and the Samsung Smart Things enviroment to automate your home, whether it's turning lights on and off, or adjusting your thermostat when you're too hot or too cold.  You can even flip on or off appliances.
