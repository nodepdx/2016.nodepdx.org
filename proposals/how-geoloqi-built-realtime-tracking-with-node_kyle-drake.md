Description
-----------

There are very powerful things you can do with Node.JS, particularly with projects needing a lot of I/O operations. At Geoloqi, we have used Node.JS and Socket.IO to build a JavaScript client that allows our developers to map real-time tracking on a browser with almost no code needed. Our first project using this is MapAttack!, a truly real-time location-based geofencing game. 

Hear about how we made the game, how we made it real-time, where we're going, and where Node.JS is going to have a role in it. I will also cover what it took to build Geoloqi's Real-time Streaming API, and how it can be used to bring real-time location functionality to existing applications.

I will also talk a little bit about the Reactor pattern, the mysterious thing underneath that powers Node.JS. I'll discuss what Reactor patterns are good for (and not so good for), and compare them with threads. I will also compare Node.JS's reactor pattern to ones in other languages.
