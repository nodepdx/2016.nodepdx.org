Description
-----------

Continuous Integration (CI) can save you time, reduce the hassles of managing open source projects, improve the overall quality of your code, and make merging a joy. But it can be a bit difficult to understand at first and a chore to setup and manage. 

In this talk we’ll break down the concepts of Continuous Integration, and take a look at Travis CI, a free, hosted solution that makes it extremely easy to add continuous integration to your open source projects. Once we have a handle on the basics, we’ll move on to more advanced topics including sending build notifications, running unit tests, linting, and automatically deploying successful builds. While the example project used in this presentation will be written in Node, the concepts discussed, as well as Travis CI itself, can be applied to almost any language, bringing value to developers from all backgrounds. Come learn how to make managing your open source projects fun again, with continuous integration and Travis CI!
