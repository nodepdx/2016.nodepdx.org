Description
-----------

PaaS Technologies from Heroku, EngineYard, AppFog, Nodejitsu, Nodester, and others are enabling node.js applications in new ways. The days of "managing the servers" are becoming a thing of the past, now we're faced with the new found power of managing our applications and focusing on application business value!

This presentation is an open, 2-way communication, scalable presentation. What I mean by that is bring your laptops with or without node.js, and we'll discuss the ins and outs of getting your node.js application deployed to the cloud via PaaS! 

Speaker Bio
-----------

I’m a jovial, TDD, BDD, get things done well, software architect, engineer, code monkey, coder, or what have you. I run the gamut of dev stacks from Ruby on Rails, Node.js and .NET. I’ll admit a favorite is Ruby these days with a growing admiration for the chaos of JavaScript. I’m passionate about devops (it is the future, get ready), love to get involved in hackathons, user groups, and other tech community events.

I do dozens of other things ranging from playing metal (thrash, death, black, progressive, etc), blues, or a bit of jazz guitar.  I also travel a lot, the majority by train, like to explore new cities, and also love to discuss sustainable buildings, transit, transportation, and vehicles in general (airplanes, cars, or trains). I’ve also been car-free for almost 3 years, wouldn’t change it for a million bucks, but still love a good race (or drift session). I however never get to do any of these things as much as I’d like to, but I have a continual blast doing them when I can, and one day maybe I’ll get that action pushed through congress to change the day to 32 hours instead of 24.  Or maybe not.
