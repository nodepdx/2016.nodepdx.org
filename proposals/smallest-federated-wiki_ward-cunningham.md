Missing from the Beginning: The Federation of Wikis
===================================================

* Speaker   : Ward Cunningham
* Available : Both Days
* Length    : 30 minutes

Description
-----------

Our new wiki innovates three ways. It shares through federation, composes by refactoring and wraps data with visualization.

The Smallest Federated Wiki project wants to be small in the "easy to learn powerful ideas" version of small. It wants to be a wiki so that strangers can meet and create works of value together. And it wants to be federated so that the burden of maintaining long-lasting content is shared among those who care.
