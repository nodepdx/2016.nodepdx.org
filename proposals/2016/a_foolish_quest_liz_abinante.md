# A Foolish Quest: Creating Knitting Patterns Using JavaScript

**Speaker:** Liz Abinante
**Availability:** I'd prefer the 20th or the 21st (I'm traveling back from Chicago on the 19th)
**Time:** Approximately 30 minutes!

## Description

Taking something real-world and math-based, like knitting, and turning into a program is actually super easy (no one is surprised here). But! What happens when you combine that with best practices and expected conventions, along with industry-wide standards for design and presentation? Things get a lot more complicated than just crunching numbers, especially when your output will result in lots of manual hours creating a real object. This is the story of how I built a customizable knitting pattern generator in JavaScript (after I built it in Ruby first, of course), and the lessons learned when you try and do math for more than just math's sake.

## Speaker bio

Liz Abinante lives in Portland, Oregon and works as a Senior Software Engineer at New Relic. She is infectiously enthusiastic about web development, teaching, learning, and feminism. She used to write JavaScript, then walked up to the wrong desk one day and now she writes some Java too. She enjoys speaking at conferences, knitting, sewing, and a hacking away on interesting problems. She swears she's a lot more interesting than this bio makes her sound. She's often been compared to cartoon characters due to her enomorous personality and penchant for sing/dancing her way through life.
