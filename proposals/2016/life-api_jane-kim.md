Life API: Using personal data for life gains and well being
========================

* Speaker   : Jane Kim
* Available : June 20-21 all day
* Length    : 25 min

Description
-----------

Personal data can be super useful, but usually keeping track of anything it involves a lot of unused mobile apps and expensive trackers. What if you could just... code your own? Using [Hoodie](http://hood.ie/intro/), an awesome front end framework with a noBackend philosophy, I created a [personal data tracking app](https://github.com/janecakemaster/life-api) that that helps me track anything and everything. With the magic of CouchDB I have access all my data points in real time and I can write tests for continuous integration that notify me if I'm adulting properly or not ([TAP](https://testanything.org/)... literally everything)

Of course, just because your tests fail doesn't mean YOU are a failure. I'll tell you how I use this tool to track personal goals (meditate once a day, how often I drink water) and how I'm feeling (how bad is my arm pain? how happy am I today?) to examine trends in my life. By the end of this talk you'll be able to use or extend the same app for all the things you want to track and achieve.

Notes
-----
Hoodie is amazing! I'd love for more people to know about it and contribute to it. Attendees will learn how magical it is during the talk. This talk is relevant to the current trend of personal tracking with devices and various apps. Not only that, but the app opens up ways for the user/coder to be in tune with things that are personal to them: their goals, mental and physical state. By bringing more awareness to these things, we can become better developers and healthier inside and out. People are prone to neglecting their mental health, so this talk helps shed some light on that.
