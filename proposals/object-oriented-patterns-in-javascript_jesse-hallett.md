Object-oriented patterns in JavaScript
======================================

Description
-----------

JavaScript is a language that is tremendously flexible, but that comes
with few clear conventions.  Code organization is one are that has been
reinvented perhaps more times than there are JavaScript programmers.
I will examine a few tools that are intended to improve the experience
of writing object-oriented code.

Some of the specific tools that I plan to examine are [traits.js][],
[CoffeeScript][], [Prototype][], and [JiverScripts][].  The goal is to
get a look at different ideas to see what each approach has to offer.
We will discuss inheritance versus composition, and question when it is
or is not appropriate to use object-oriented code.

[CoffeeScript]: http://coffeescript.org/
[Prototype]: http://prototypejs.org/learn/class-inheritance
[JiverScripts]: https://github.com/jivesoftware/jiverscripts

Audience participation is encouraged: if you have a favorite OO
implementation, or experiences with JavaScript code organization, feel
free to come and to share.
