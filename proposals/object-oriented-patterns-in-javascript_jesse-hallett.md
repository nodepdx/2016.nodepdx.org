Description
-----------

JavaScript is a language that is tremendously flexible, but that comes
with few clear conventions.  Code organization is one area that has been
reinvented time and again, with perhaps more implementations than there
are JavaScript programmers.

A good code organization pattern should allow code to be easily reused
in new contexts, should provide encapsulation and clean separation of
behaviors, and should minimize risks of name collisions.  In this
presentation I will examine some techniques that aim to address these
concerns.  In particular I will focus on [traits.js][] and on type
classes / protocols, comparing and contrasting the particular benefits
that these techniques introduce.
