Geddy - A better framework for building apps on node
========================

* Speaker   : Daniel Erickson
* Available : Feb 11-12, any time
* Length    : 45 mins

Description
-----------

Many frameworks have been created to allow you to build apps on Node.js - Express, Matador, and Flatiron to name a few. But none of these frameworks are built with development velocity, backwards compatibility, *and* speed. This is where Geddy steps in. Geddy is a framework built and battle tested by the JS team at Yammer. It's currently running our upload service. During this talk I'll walk you through building a basic web app with geddy, and show you how we used it to build a prototype mobile site for Yammer in less than 12 hours.
