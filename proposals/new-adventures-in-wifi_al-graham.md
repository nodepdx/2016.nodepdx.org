Description
-----------

IoT is a great buzz term these days, but how does one get started... there's so much possibility, but is it *too* much?

As a newcomer to hardware hacking, I want to encourage everyone to give it a go, and share my experiences starting out in this world -what I've found is easy, what is hard, where to start, all the big questions that keep us up at night once the RasPi (or internet button, or Arduino or whatever) arrives.

This talk will take attendees through my journey in hardware hacking, giving tips as to how to combine the love of Node, Adventure Time and flashing lights with the possibilites of the hardware platforms that are out there, and hopefully encourge everyone to give it a go!

Al's a developer with Red Hat, creating mobile centered API's and apps with their Mobile Application Platform, and a new convert to the joys of IoT. He's a kind of Irish ex-pat living in the UK who has never yet been described as nature's answer to the question "Have you got anything bigger than a possum, but smaller than a bear?" - but he lives in hope. GSOH.
