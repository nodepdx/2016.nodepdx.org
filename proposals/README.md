How To Submit A Proposal
========================

* Create a **Github account** if you don't have one already
* **Fork this repository**
* **Create and commit a .MD file** in this directory named after the talk title and your name. For example, if your talk is called "Intro To Node.js" and your name is John Doe, name the file **intro-to-nodejs_john-doe.md**
* When you're ready, **submit a pull request**
* **Wait patiently** and nicely for us to contact you. We will respond to everyone who submits a proposal even if it's just to say "Thanks but no thanks".

What should be in the proposal?
-------------------------------

Every proposal should have, at minimum, the following information: 

* Your Name
* Your Availability (what days/times you are able to do this presentation)
* Presentation Title
* Presentation Description
* Presentation Length (in minutes/hours/days)

If you'd like to add in a **personal bio** or other details like links to your **blog**, **open source projects**, **company**, or what have you, that's completely up to you. Whatever floats your boat. Bios are nice!  :)

To make this easier, I've created a template you can copy and modify. See **proposal-template_troy-howard.md** in this directory.

If you have any other artifacts that relate to your presentation, like slide decks, code samples, videos, etc, make a directory named the same as your presentation.md and put the files in there. For example, if my proposal was saved in **intro-to-nodejs_john-doe.md**, place the example code in **~/nodepdx.github.com/proposals/intro-to-nodejs_john-doe/example-code.js** 

What are we looking for?
------------------------

We're looking for anything related to JavaScript, not limited to just Node.js. It can be Node.js, UX Flow & UI Magic, JavaScript Practices, Patterns or how to fly a spaceship with JavaScript or build a giant robot run by Node.js or something. It's all possible, with the core idea of JavaScript driven. 

We're also open to suggestions for unconference topics & especially any hardware hacking. For example, suppose you really want to hack and talk about Arduinos but don't have a presentation, maybe just some questions or experiences to share? We can set aside a 30 minute block of time where we just dedicate a room to that topic. Anyone can show up who wants to discuss the topic. We're flexible.
