Conquering Fears with Poetry (and Javascript)
========================

* Speaker   : Jane Kim
* Available : June 20-21 all day
* Length    : 25 min

Description
-----------

Lots of things in life are scary. For me, code is one of those scary things, but sometimes you have to push yourself into the deep end. Instead of writing another todo app to learn new stuff (because seriously, who wants to write another todo app??), I found a way to combine code with another thing I love: poetry. That's how Exq was created-- a Twilio/Firebase app that enables strangers to write dope poetry with each other. This talk is all about my journey to realizing that I am a programmer, how poetry got involved, and juggling work/life/personal projects.

Notes
-----
This is a *feelings* and *inspiration* talk. I talk a little bit about implementation (using firebase as a quick data store in lieu of a backend, choosing a framework) but it's a lot about my journey as a programmer and things like imposter syndrome.
