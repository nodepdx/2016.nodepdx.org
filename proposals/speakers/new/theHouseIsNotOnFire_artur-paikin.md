The House Is Not On Fire: Building a home automation robot with Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Node.js
========================

* Speaker   : Artur Paikin
* Available : April 20 or 21, any time during the conference
* Length    : 20–30 mins

Description
-----------

I’ve built an open source home automation system called [Koti Home](https://github.com/arturi/kotihome) (Koti means home in Finnish language). It’s powered by an Arduino connected to Raspberry Pi, MQTT protocol for messaging, Node.js on the client and server, web sockets. You can interact with Koti robot via a React (like the cool kids do) control panel, Telegram Chat Bot and even your own voice.

I’d like to talk about how I’ve turned this project into reality — the tech I used and the chanllanges I faced. From a blinking LED to a voice controlled home automation robot.  I gave a [similar talk at Queens.js](http://www.meetup.com/QueensJS/events/227320843/).

I’m a web developer and traveler. I write stories about my adventures in Russian and English on my site: http://arturpaikin.com and run a small technology cooperative called [Baguette](http://unebaguette.com), where I work on cool projects, currently building an ambitious next generation file uploader with [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com/). I ride a [foldable bicycle](https://www.instagram.com/p/xC0qC2SSYb), [teach](http://unebaguette.com/web-course/) web development and sometimes [garden](https://www.instagram.com/p/4_6LO8ySVL/) on the balcony.
