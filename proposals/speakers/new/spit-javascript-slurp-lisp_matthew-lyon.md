(spit javascript (slurp lisp))
========================

* Speaker   : Matthew Lyon
* Available : April 20 or 21
* Length    : 30 mins

Description
-----------

You've probably heard of Lisp, an ancient programming language venerated by
programmers of a certain type. Sure, you might consider yourself primarily a
JavaScript programmer, but I'll explain why Lisp is worth learning and how
learning it will help you write better JavaScript, and become a better
programmer in general.

I'll also show off two ways to write Lisp that compiles to JavaScript --
[sibilant][] and [clojurescript][], at risk of being booed offstage for asking
you to use a transpiler.

[clojurescript]: https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript
