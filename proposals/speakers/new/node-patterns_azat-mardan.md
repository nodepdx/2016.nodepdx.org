This presentation is for you, if you’re a JavaScript engineer who is interested in deepening your understanding of Node.js patterns so you can create and design Node.js applications intelligently. With the right pattern, applications will be more scalable and easier to maintain. If you aspire one day to become a Node.js architect (or maybe you’re already one and want to extend your knowledge), this presentation is for you.

You will learn from this talk:
* Starting with basic: what is event loop and callback: setTimeout(), setImmediate() and process.nextTick()
