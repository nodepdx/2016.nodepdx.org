Happy Sparkle Glitter Fun Zone - Leds and Javascript
========================

* Speaker   : Russell Hay
* Available : Jun 19-21st, I could make that work with my job
* Length    : 30 minutes

Description
-----------

This talk is about how, with a little bit of knowledge, a ton of RGB LEDs, and some low power computers, you can make amazing things. I will include examples of what people have built using javascript + leds, and the available options for the different leds. I will cover how to get yourself up and running in quick order using Johnny-five + node-pixel on a small, low-cost, low-power device running javascript (a beaglebone black), and how to connect the board to outside sources to provide intelligent displays that can take data from the world, and turn it into a visualization on a strip of leds. I will show how to take a strip of 240 leds and drive them all with j5 using the new i2c backpack for neo-pixels.

The focus is on interactive art using leds and code to make fun things you can put in your home, or in public spaces.

Speaker Bio
-----------

I'm a software engineer with a passion for creative endeavors, that usually include LEDs in some way. I look for ways to bring my passionate for software into the realm of art and costuming. I run a very small, artist collective called Stainless.io that is really bad at documenting it's work, and pretty lazy when it
comes to completing things.
