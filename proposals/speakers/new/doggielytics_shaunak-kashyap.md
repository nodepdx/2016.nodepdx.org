Description
-----------

My wife and I are proud parents of a 5-year old labradoodle named Seger (after that great rock ‘n roller, Bob Seger). Seger has a little doggie door through which he visits our backyard. Sometimes he rushes out of it to chase a squirrel, sometimes he just saunters out of it to go and... do his business. Sometimes Seger spends just a few dozen seconds in the backyard while at other times he’s gone for several minutes.

As a fun project to scratch my hardware-hacking itch, I decided to try and track Seger's visits to the backyard. I bought myself a [Tessel](http://tessel.io/), installed it on his doggie door and uploaded some code to it to track the door swings. Then I needed a place to store the door swing data and visualize it. So I taught myself a bit of [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) and [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) and boom... within a few weekends of hacking, I was staring at pretty charts showing Seger’s visits to the backyard. What a fun little project to get my hands dirty with three new technologies - Tessel, Elasticsearch, and Kibana!

In this talk I'll walk through my project, Doggielytics, covering the basics of Tessel, Elasticsearch, and Kibana. We'll learn how to write, upload and run code on the Tessel. We'll learn how to store the data being produced by the Tessel in Elasticsearch and then learn how to query and visualize it in Kibana. I will show live demonstrations - sorry, no Seger included :( - throughout the presentation and leave you with resources to get started with your own fun hardware-hacking project!
