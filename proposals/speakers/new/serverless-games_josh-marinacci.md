Description
-----------

Building a multiplayer casual game is fun until you have to write a server
component to run it. Now you have to implement game matching, keeping clients in
sync, in game chat, score tracking and more. In this talk I’ll show you how to
use a Data Stream Network (DSN) write a game without any server at all. The
network itself can connect users, load clients, and keep everything in sync
without having to learn distributed computing programming. We will build and
play a MMOWAM (Massively Multiplayer Online Whack-A-Mole) game to show how easy
it can be.

- game MMOWAM (whack-a-mole)
- show mini version of each player on dashboard
- show current score / level
- show how much is left
- random number syncing to ensure everyone has the same board
- use a random channel w/ tiny UID to let anyone join
- show number of players
- start when 4 players in? one player hit’s start? let all player see total count as well and status of the other players
