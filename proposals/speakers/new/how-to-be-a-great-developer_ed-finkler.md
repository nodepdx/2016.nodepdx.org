Description
-----------
The best developers aren't always those with amazing programming chops, but are those who can empathize, communicate, and interpret project requirements. But many of us get caught in the trap of measuring ability purely in technical skill, ignoring other traits that have enormous impact on productivity and outcome. If we want to be great developers, we must value those skills just as highly as tech skills, because we need them to anticipate and solve our users' problems, and work effectively with our colleagues. In this talk, we'll examine why these non-technical skills have such an impact on us as developers, and how to apply them to our work.

Here is an outline of my talk:
### HOW TO BE A GREAT DEVELOPER

#### TECH SKILLS ARE OVERRATED
* It’s not that they don’t matter. They just are wildly overrated.
* In fact, I’d argue that the things I talk about here are *more* important than tech skills.

#### FIVE MAJOR PRINCIPLES
* Practice Empathy
* Practice Humility
* Always Be Learning
* Avoid Tribalism
* Better Your Community

#### PRACTICE EMPATHY
* Empathy is the ability to understand how a person feels, and why they may feel that way.
* Empathy is your most important skill.
* Practice it with everyone you interact with, and everyone who interacts with your work.
* Always keep two groups in mind: the users and the rest of your team. They are the ones affected by the decisions you make.
* Solving the user’s problems should be your focus, not solving your problems.
* Understanding — empathizing with — the user is what allows you to solve their problem.
* When making coding choices, remember the person or people who will need to read, understand, and extend your work.
* Make it clear why you chose what you did. Do your best to anticipate their questions and points of confusion.

#### PRACTICE HUMILITY
* Humility goes hand in hand with empathy
* You’re wrong about many things
* You’ll always be learning and improving. Accept and own-up to mistakes.
* The less you fear being wrong, the more confident you can be.
* So is everyone else
* Allow others to practice humility

#### ALWAYS BE LEARNING
* Be liberal in learning about new technologies and approaches. Be conservative in using them.
* Any technology can be the right choice depending on the needs of the project and strengths of the team.
* Set aside a little time each week to learn about new tech.
* At conferences, try to catch one or two talks about technologies you don’t know much about.

#### AVOID TRIBALISM
* Refuse to participate in tribalism.
* Build communities with what we have in common. Embrace diversity. Help people feel safe.
* View absolute statements with extreme skepticism.
* Dismissing a technology without a sound, reasonable argument is lazy and prone to error.
* Be extremely careful about participating in X vs Y arguments.
* Reserve your loyalty for people. Not brands. Not companies. Not technologies.

#### BETTER YOUR COMMUNITY
* Make people’s lives better with your skills.
* Make the community around you better. You don’t need to go to some Magic City of Tech Genius to do important work.
* Share what you learn with the people around you. Ask them to share what they have learned with you.

#### BUT I’M A SUPERVISOR!
* Great developers need a great org to support them
* Values of a hierarchical org distribute from the top down
* Supervisors on all levels have to be consistent about adopting and applying these values
* It is much easier to be angry or negative. You must practice empathy, and enforce by example and procedure
* Talk less. Listen more. Ask in order to understand.
