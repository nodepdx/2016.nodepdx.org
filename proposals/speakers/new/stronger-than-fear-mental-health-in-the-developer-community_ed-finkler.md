Description
-----------
Mental disorders are the largest contributor to disease burden in North America, but the developer community and those who employ us are afraid to face the problem head-on. In this talk, we'll examine the state of mental health awareness in the developer workplace, why most developers feel it isn't safe to talk about mental health, and what we can do to change the culture and save lives. Attendees will leave with 5 things they can do to make their workplace safer for those dealing with mental health disorders.

### Abstract/bullet points

Primarily this will focus on findings from the 2014 and 2016 Mental Health in Tech Surveys (http://funkatron.com/posts/the-mental-health-in-tech-survey.html). We received over 1100 responses, and you can view the raw data here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FqpxZXORRNDQ4niSeqLx0Qy2VfUod_qlAvpnOyTEB9k/viewanalytics

Essentially the talk will break down as such:

    + I'm like 20% of the population
- Cover the state of mental disorders as the #1 cause of disease burden
- Show data points from survey
- Present possible conclusions based on the data
    + Devs do not feel safe discussing mental health in the workplace
- Present solutions to combat this
    + Mental Health First Aid
    + Vacation and Sick Leave policies

    + Prominently presenting available mental health resources
