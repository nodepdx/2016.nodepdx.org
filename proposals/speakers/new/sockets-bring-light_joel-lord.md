More and more, people seem to be obsessed with real-time data.  But what does real-time mean in the world of REST servers and one-way communication?  Most modern web applications are now either displaying a snapshot of data at a given time or use a polling mechanism to update series of data at a given interval.
In this talk, you will learn about the power of WebSockets and how they can (and should!) be used in your modern web applications. In these 30 minutes, I will go through the process of building a Node server that can push data to multiple clients in real-time.  You will see how this can be easy using the socket.io library.
