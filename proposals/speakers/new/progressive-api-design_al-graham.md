Description
-----------

Why should front end developers have all the fun? With the explosion of approaches to developing client apps, is there more that can be done on the server side to cater for them?

Progressive API design is a modular approach that gives greater flexibility to the server, and allows us to tailor our responses to the client, and easily provide the best experience for whatever the next big thing may be.

We'll start with a brief overview of the issues related to mobile development in particular, but also in the wider client side world, and highlight some of the approaches currently taken to solve these. Then it's time to introduce the idea of Progressive API's and take everyone through a sample setup, explaining the thought process, and showing how simple it should be!
