Presentation Title: Build your child their very own Node.js Frozen bot

Presentation Description:
A 5-year-old sister who watches Frozen all day might be quite annoying to some, but not to me. Instead, I fell in love with the movie too and catch myself constantly singing its hit song, “Let It Go.” Now that I have moved out of my house for my job, my sister no longer has a sing-a-long buddy, so I figured I would make her one.
Node.js is a server that runs JavaScript. Because of Node, we are now able to run JavaScript in places other than the browser, which allows us to run JavaScript on the Arduino. Johnny-Five was created to be the programming framework for JavaScript robotics. The framework is compatible with a variety of platforms including the Raspberry Pi,
Intel Edison, Particle Photon, and many more. However, the Arduino is Johnny-Five’s most compatible platform.
You’ll get hands-on experience with an Arduino and its different functionalities using Node. We’ll start with setting your Arduino up and getting the Johnny Five framework ready on your machine and continue through getting your voice recognition functionality working properly and having your NodeBot sing to you. Keep in mind that to use the
voice-recognition feature with the Arduino, we’ll need a few additional pieces of hardware, including a microphone, a breadboard, and some LEDs to test that everything is working. There will be a thorough breakdown of the wiring, explaining exactly what each wire is accomplishing and why these pieces are needed for the project.

Presentation Duration: 45min to 1hr
