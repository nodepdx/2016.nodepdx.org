Description

This talk will give a sneak peek of the most interesting and powerful Node.js features. Node.js is quickly capturing the programming world not just in web, but in IoT, drones, robots and embedded systems.

Do you use Node tool such as Grunt, Gulp or Webpack to build your front-end assets.
Do you use an HTTP server built with Express?
Do you generate code using Yeoman?
But do you really know Node?

If you are a geek like most of us, then you’d appreciate this presentation.
You’ll become more confident in the internals of Node.js and understand how certain things work.
Node.js is fast and scalable web-oriented non-blocking I/O built on top of Google Chrome V8 engine. Almost every web developer uses Node or Node-based tools to some extent. However, Node has some really powerful features worth knowing.

This talk dives deep into the core mechanisms of the Node.js platform and some of its most interesting features such as:

* Event Loop: Brush-up on the core concept which enables the non-blocking I/O
* Streams and buffers: Effective way to work with data
* Process and global: How to access more info
* Event emitters: Crash course in the event-based pattern
* Clusters: Fork processes like a pro
* AsyncWrap, Domain and uncaughtException: Handling async errors
* C++ addons: Contributing to the core and writing your own C++ addons
