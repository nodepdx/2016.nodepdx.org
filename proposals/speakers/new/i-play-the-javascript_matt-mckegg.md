Description
-----------

I have been making music with computers for about 10 years, but once I tried to move from bedroom composing to live performance, I got incredibly frustrated at how hard it was to play computer music live. For some crazy reason, I decided to start working on my own live electronic performance software written in JavaScript that would let me play the way I want to play. 3 years later, it's finally starting to become a reality.

I would like to talk about how I use JavaScript, Web Audio/MIDI and Electron to drop the beats and bring the vibes, and the new possibilities available to all with desktop "web" applications!

Here is a video of a recent (100% JavaScript powered) performance I gave at a music festival in February: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2BVDJWHdy0&t=1032

And here is a video of a similar talk I gave (will probably be revised considerably though) at JSConf.asia: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NL0nb8A8FDM
