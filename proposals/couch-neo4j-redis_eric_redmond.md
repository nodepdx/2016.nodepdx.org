A CouchDB, Neo4j, Redis, and Node.JS Circus
========================

* Speaker   : Eric Redmond
* Available : Later is better
* Length    : 45 mins

Description
-----------

NoSQL databases are fun, and we've all wired up a Node.js project to use one. But what about two?
What about *three*?

That's what's on the docket for this talk. We'll do **all the things**:

- Walk through a (very) quick intro on CouchDB, Neo4j, and Redis.
- Then learn how to interact with these very different databases using Node.js.
- Then wire them up into a single web application (using Bricks.js, for good measure)
- Write it all in CoffeeScript... *buzzword overload!!!*

If you do not walk out of this talk excited and maybe a little confused, I will have failed.

Eric works at MongoHQ and has spent the last 17 years writing a book on databases (seemingly).
He also just might be the world's most over-educated and underqualified marketing director.
