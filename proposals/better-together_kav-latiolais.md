Description
-----------
If you're not using node to build collaborative real time applications you might as well be using rails. In this talk we'll discuss patterns and pitfalls of synchronous node apps. We'll roll up our sleeves and dig into some code demonstrating patterns that can help you get started building highly interactive applications that sync real time state with Node.js, Socket.io, and Backbone.js. You will leave this talk with insight on how to build synchronous experiences into your applications and avoid some of the pitfalls we've suffered.
